# Dataverse Email Checker
Dataverse Email Checker (DEC) is an application to compare a list of email addresses against Dataverse and Entra users.

The tool shows if the email address belongs to a Dataverse user (Enabled or Disabled), to an Entra user (Enabled or Disabled), to an Entra User not inside Dataverse (Enabled or Disabled) and if there are email addresses not found inside Entra.

The email lists can be downloaded as CSV file (icon &#x1f4e9;) and for "Enabled Entra Users not inside Dataverse" it is also possible to download a CSV file (icon &#x1f4e5;) for bulk import inside an Entra group (for example the one defined as security group for the Dataverse envinronment).

**Demo**: https://guidopreite.github.io/DEC/

For the Demo you can use the following list of email addresses:

user1@contoso.com
user2@contoso.com
user3@contoso.com
user4@contoso.com
user5@contoso.com
user6@contoso.com
